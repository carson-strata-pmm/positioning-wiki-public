# Messaging Framework Rubric

## Definition

A scoring rubric for evaluating the quality of a B2B SaaS messaging framework across five dimensions. This rubric produces a diagnostic that identifies exactly where a framework is strong, where it breaks, and what to fix first.

## What This Rubric Is For

This rubric evaluates **messaging frameworks** -- the operational source-of-truth document that contains audience, hero problem, pillars, value propositions, differentiation, and copy bank. It does not evaluate POV narratives, homepages, or pitch decks. Each document type has different evaluation criteria because each serves a different function:

- A **messaging framework** is a structured reference architecture. It should be searchable, modular, and internally consistent. It is graded on structural completeness, pillar construction, buyer specificity, and competitive clarity.
- A **POV narrative** is a persuasive story. It is graded on opening strategy strength, narrative arc, and emotional momentum -- criteria that are irrelevant for a framework.
- A **homepage** is a compressed expression of the framework. It is graded on above-the-fold clarity, page architecture, and CTA design -- criteria that don't apply to a framework document.
- A **pitch deck** is a narrative delivery format. It is graded on slide-level clarity, narrative flow, and proof slide structure.

Evaluating a framework on narrative criteria (e.g., "the opening isn't compelling") or evaluating a POV on structural criteria (e.g., "the pillars aren't balanced") produces meaningless feedback. Match the rubric to the document type.

## The Five Dimensions

### 1. Hero Problem Clarity

**What to evaluate:**

- **Is the hero problem named?** Does it have a specific, ownable name -- not a description? A name is 2-4 words that can be referenced in shorthand. "The Headcount Headache" is a name. "Companies struggle to manage headcount across fragmented tools" is a description.
- **Does it indict a structural system, not a symptom?** Symptoms describe what happens. Systems explain why it keeps happening by design. "Legal costs are rising" is a symptom. "The billable hour model concentrates expertise by design, making elite judgment artificially scarce" is a structural indictment.
- **Is it specific enough that only this company could name it?** Generic hero problems ("companies struggle with X") fail this test. The name should be so precise that a competitor using it would sound like they're copying.
- **Does the name itself carry meaning without context?** The strongest hero problem names are self-contained arguments. "The Customer Value Paradox" tells you something is structurally broken about how customer value works before you read a single line of explanation.

**Scoring guide:**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **5/5** | Named, structural, ownable, self-contained. Could not belong to any other company or category. |
| **4/5** | Named and structural but could apply to adjacent categories with minor rewording. |
| **3/5** | Named but describes a symptom rather than a systemic cause. |
| **2/5** | Unnamed or describes multiple problems rather than one singular problem. |
| **1/5** | Generic, vague, or indistinguishable from competitor framing. |

**Calibration examples:**

- **Strong (4-5):** A hero problem that names the structural reason elite legal expertise is artificially scarce -- indicting the model that created the scarcity, not the scarcity itself as a symptom. (An AI-native law firm engagement named the architectural cause rather than the felt effect -- identifying a constraint imposed by the operating model itself.)
- **Weak (1-2):** "Companies struggle with legal costs and inefficiency" -- describes symptoms, not the system that produces them. No name, no structure, no ownership.

See [[concepts/hero-problem-framing]] for the full naming framework and archetype taxonomy.

### 2. Pillar Construction

**What to evaluate:**

- **Are there exactly three pillars?** Three is the standard. Four pillars can work for identity-burden hero problems (one healthcare practice management engagement used a "dual responsibility" framework with four pillars), but this is the exception and should be justified.
- **Does each pillar name a distinct dimension of the hero problem -- no overlap?** If two pillars describe the same underlying problem with different labels, the structure is redundant.
- **Do the pillars follow a logical sequence?** Strong sequences: process -> outcome, input -> throughput -> output, operational -> strategic. Weak sequences: no discernible logic to the ordering.
- **Does each pillar mirror cleanly to a value pillar?** The inversion should be obvious and direct. If a pain pillar can't be flipped into a value statement, it's either too vague or not a real buyer pain.
- **Are pillar names 2-3 word noun phrases?** Gold standard. Sentence fragments are acceptable. Full sentences are weak -- they're hard to reference in shorthand and don't function as labels.
- **Does each pillar have a cause stack and a consequence?** Not just a label. Each pillar should replicate the three-layer problem architecture: name -> causes -> consequences.

**Scoring guide:**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **5/5** | Three distinct, non-overlapping pillars. Clean sequence. Direct mirror to value pillars. 2-3 word noun phrase names. Full cause-consequence stack. |
| **4/5** | Three distinct pillars, good sequence, minor overlap in one pillar or slightly thin cause stack. |
| **3/5** | Three pillars but two overlap meaningfully, or one pillar restates the hero problem rather than decomposing it. |
| **2/5** | Fewer than three pillars, or pillars describe features/capabilities rather than buyer pain dimensions. |
| **1/5** | No clear pillar structure, or pillars are generic enough to apply to any B2B company. |

**Calibration examples:**

- **Strong (5/5):** A headcount management platform (Series B) built three pillars that decomposed the hero problem along completely different dimensions -- data trust (visibility), governance gaps (control), and manual overhead (productivity). Each had a distinct cause stack and quantified consequences. No overlap. Clean upstream-to-downstream sequence.
- **Weak (2/5):** An employee recognition platform (Series B) had Pillar 1 restate the hero problem rather than decomposing it into a distinct dimension. Two pillars described capacity problems with different labels. Consequences were vague throughout.

See [[concepts/problem-architecture]] for how pillars replicate the fractal three-layer pattern.

### 3. Buyer Specificity

**What to evaluate:**

- **Is the primary buyer clearly named in the ICP section with a specific title, not a generic role?** "VP Finance / Head of FP&A" is specific. "Finance leader" is borderline. "Senior executive" fails.
- **Is the messaging written for that specific buyer's world -- their language, their stakes, their success metrics?** A GC cares about judgment quality and strategic leverage. A CFO cares about cost predictability and capital efficiency. The same product positioned to each requires fundamentally different language.
- **Would a different buyer find this messaging jarring or irrelevant?** This is the acid test. If you could send the framework to a CFO and a GC and both would nod, it's not specific enough.
- **Does the framework distinguish between primary and secondary buyers and maintain appropriate hierarchy?** The primary buyer should dominate the messaging. The secondary buyer should be acknowledged but subordinate.
- **Are the problem pillars framed in the primary buyer's language -- not the vendor's language about the buyer's problem?** "Matter volume exceeds capacity" is buyer language. "Our AI handles more matters" is vendor language about the same reality.

**Scoring guide:**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **5/5** | Every claim is contextualized to the named primary buyer. Pillars use the buyer's own language. Secondary buyer is acknowledged but subordinate. |
| **4/5** | Mostly buyer-specific but one or two pillars drift toward vendor language or could apply to a different buyer persona. |
| **3/5** | Buyer is named but messaging reads as generic B2B -- could apply to multiple buyer types without modification. |
| **2/5** | Messaging conflates primary and secondary buyers, trying to serve both equally and serving neither well. |
| **1/5** | No clear buyer specificity. Could be sent to any senior leader at any company. |

**Calibration examples:**

- **Strong (5/5):** A home services AI platform (Series B) targeted the owner-operator and used their language throughout -- framing value in terms of booking more jobs, recovering missed calls, and scaling the front office. A VP of Marketing at a SaaS company would find this messaging irrelevant. That's the point.
- **Weak (2/5):** A framework targeting a General Counsel that leads with cost savings and efficiency metrics. Correct outcome, wrong buyer language. GCs care about judgment quality and strategic leverage, not just cost. The messaging would resonate more with a CFO -- which means it's not specific enough for either.

See [[concepts/two-buyer-problem]] for how to handle multi-buyer dynamics and [[concepts/icp-signal-patterns]] for buyer archetype taxonomy.

### 4. Clarity & Specificity

**What to evaluate:**

- **Could any claim in this framework be copy-pasted into a competitor's framework without modification?** If yes, that claim fails. Every statement should be so specific to this company's mechanism, buyer, and position that a competitor would have to rewrite it.
- **Are USPs actually unique?** Generic USPs include: "easy to use," "enterprise-grade," "best-in-class," "comprehensive," "scalable." These are table stakes, not differentiators. A USP must name something only this company can credibly say.
- **Is every proof point or capability claim traceable to a specific mechanism?** "We're faster" fails. "We reduce contract review time because AI handles first-pass review before an attorney touches it" passes. The mechanism is what makes the claim believable.
- **Are value pillar statements concrete outcomes or vague aspirations?** "Transform your legal function" fails. "Legal reviews contracts in 24 hours instead of 5 days" passes.
- **Does the framework avoid filler language?** Filler words: "leverage," "best-in-class," "seamless," "powerful," "next-generation," "cutting-edge," "holistic," "robust." These words mean nothing and signal that the writer didn't have a specific claim to make.

**Scoring guide:**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **5/5** | Every claim is specific, mechanistic, and un-copyable. No filler. Every USP names something only this company can credibly say. |
| **4/5** | Most claims are specific. One or two USPs are slightly generic but grounded in a real differentiator. |
| **3/5** | Mix of specific and generic claims. Some USPs could belong to competitors. Some filler language present. |
| **2/5** | Majority of claims are generic. Framework reads like a category description rather than a company position. |
| **1/5** | Entirely generic. Could be a competitor's framework with the logo swapped. |

**Calibration examples:**

- **Strong (5/5):** A claim describing how each client matter strengthens a cumulative knowledge base of company context, legal history, and risk preferences -- so advice becomes more precise over time. Specific mechanism (learning from each matter), specific outcome (increasing precision), un-copyable (requires a specific product architecture to deliver).
- **Weak (1-2):** "We provide comprehensive legal support with fast turnaround times and predictable pricing." True for every AI-native law firm. Not a differentiator. The competitor could paste this verbatim.

See [[concepts/value-over-features]] for the inversion pattern that converts feature language into value language.

### 5. Competitive Clarity

**What to evaluate:**

- **Is there a named architectural enemy -- not a product competitor, but the model, system, or approach that is structurally incapable of solving the hero problem?** The enemy is the operating model, not the company. "Traditional law firms" is close but too broad. "The billable hour model" is precise -- it names the mechanism that creates the structural failure.
- **Is the contrast specific?** "We're better than legacy tools" fails. "The billable hour model rewards activity not outcomes, creating incentives permanently misaligned with the buyer's goals" passes. The contrast should explain *why* the alternative fails, not just *that* it fails.
- **Would a buyer reading the differentiation section immediately understand why the alternative is architecturally incapable?** Not just worse -- *incapable*. The contrast should make the buyer realize the old approach can never solve this problem, no matter how much it improves.
- **Is the competitive contrast fair and credible?** Overstating competitor weaknesses undermines trust. The strongest competitive framing acknowledges what the alternative does well and then explains why that's not enough.
- **Does the framework define what the company is NOT as clearly as what it IS?** "We are not a traditional law firm that happens to use AI" is clarifying. It draws a bright line.

**Scoring guide:**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **5/5** | Named architectural enemy. Specific, credible contrast. Buyer immediately understands why the alternative fails structurally. The "not this" is as clear as the "this." |
| **4/5** | Named enemy and specific contrast but one competitive claim is slightly overstated or could be more mechanistic. |
| **3/5** | Enemy is implied but not named. Contrast exists but reads as feature comparison rather than architectural indictment. |
| **2/5** | No named enemy. Differentiation is generic ("we're faster, cheaper, easier") without explaining the structural reason why. |
| **1/5** | No competitive differentiation. Framework reads as if no alternatives exist. |

**Calibration examples:**

- **Strong (5/5):** "Traditional law firms generate revenue by selling time, creating incentives permanently misaligned with client goals. The billable hour model rewards activity, not outcomes -- making it structurally incapable of aligning legal costs with business value." Names the model. Explains the mechanism. Shows why it can't be fixed incrementally.
- **Weak (2/5):** "Unlike traditional law firms, we offer faster turnaround and predictable pricing." Feature comparison, not architectural indictment. Doesn't explain *why* traditional firms are slow or expensive -- just that they are.

See [[concepts/category-positioning]] for the named enemy principle and differentiation table patterns.

## What a Perfect Framework Looks Like

A 5/5 across all dimensions means:

1. **The hero problem has a name that is a self-contained argument.** You can say the name in a meeting and the buyer immediately understands the systemic tension -- no explanation needed.
2. **Three pillars decompose the hero problem into non-overlapping dimensions with full cause-consequence stacks.** Each pillar is a mini problem architecture. No pillar restates the hero problem. No two pillars overlap.
3. **Every claim is written in the primary buyer's language and contextualized to their world.** A different buyer persona would find the messaging jarring. That's the specificity test.
4. **Zero generic claims -- every USP is un-copyable.** No competitor could paste any line from this framework into their own without it sounding wrong.
5. **A named architectural enemy with a mechanistic explanation of why it fails.** The buyer understands not just that the alternative is worse, but that it's *structurally incapable* of solving the problem.

**The total score range is 5-25.** Use this guide:

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| **22-25** | Production-ready. Framework can drive website, sales deck, and outbound without additional strategic work. |
| **18-21** | Strong foundation. One or two dimensions need tightening before the framework can drive downstream deliverables reliably. |
| **13-17** | Structural gaps. Framework has the right shape but key dimensions are weak. Downstream deliverables will inherit these weaknesses. |
| **8-12** | Needs rework. Multiple dimensions are weak. Using this framework as-is will produce generic, unconvincing messaging. |
| **5-7** | Start over. The framework describes a category, not a company position. |

## Common Framework Mistakes

### Mistake 1: The Hero Problem Is a Description, Not a Name

**Weak:** "Companies waste time and money on fragmented headcount management processes."
**Strong:** "The Headcount Headache."

The description is accurate but unmemorable. It can't be referenced in shorthand. It doesn't compress the tension into something that sticks. A named hero problem becomes organizational vocabulary -- teams start saying "the headcount headache" in meetings. A description gets paraphrased differently by every person who hears it.

### Mistake 2: Pillar 1 Restates the Hero Problem

**Weak:** An employee recognition platform (Series B) named its hero problem around ad hoc gifting, then made Pillar 1 "ad hoc gifting." This isn't decomposition -- it's repetition. The pillar should name a *dimension* of the hero problem, not the hero problem itself.

**Strong:** A headcount management platform (Series B) named its hero problem "The Headcount Headache" and made Pillar 1 about data trust -- one specific dimension (data quality) of the broader problem.

### Mistake 3: Value Pillars Are Abstract Labels

**Weak:** Single-word abstractions like "Expertise," "Scale," "Delight" -- labels that could describe any B2B product. These aren't value statements; they're categories. (An employee recognition platform engagement exhibited this pattern.)

**Strong:** A home services AI platform (Series B) used outcome-oriented value pillars framed in the buyer's own language -- specific results like booking more jobs, scaling the front office, and gaining visibility into every call. Each pillar told the buyer exactly what they get.

### Mistake 4: USPs Are Table Stakes

**Weak:** "Easy to implement," "Enterprise-grade security," "24/7 support." Every competitor claims these. They don't differentiate; they reassure. Reassurance belongs in an FAQ, not in the USP section.

**Strong:** A home services AI platform (Series B) used USPs like per-call ROI tracking and sub-three-second answer time. These are verifiable in a demo and specific to the product's architecture. A competitor would have to build different technology to match these claims.

### Mistake 5: Differentiation Is Feature Comparison

**Weak:** "Unlike competitors, we have AI-powered automation and real-time analytics." This is a feature list with "unlike competitors" prepended. It doesn't explain *why* competitors can't or won't build these features.

**Strong:** A customer AI agent platform (Series A) indicted the human-led service model as structurally incapable of scaling customer intimacy -- more people means more handoffs means worse experience, by design. The enemy isn't a competitor; it's the operating model.

### Mistake 6: Consequences Are Unquantified

**Weak:** Vague consequence language like "gifts don't land" or "inequitable experiences." These are real but vague. How much do they cost? How often do they happen? What's the business impact? (An employee recognition platform engagement exhibited this pattern.)

**Strong:** A headcount management platform (Series B) quantified consequences precisely -- citing hundreds of thousands in unapproved headcount costs and the majority of time wasted on manual processes. These numbers make the invisible visible and create procurement-ready urgency.

### Mistake 7: Messaging Conflates Two Buyers

**Weak:** A framework that tries to speak to both the GC and the CFO equally, alternating between legal language and financial language. Neither buyer feels the messaging is for them.

**Strong:** A legal AI platform (Series B) recognized that its CLO and alternative legal function audiences needed separate frameworks entirely. One hero problem space, two completely different pillar structures, buyer languages, and proof points.

## How This Rubric Differs By Document Type

This rubric evaluates messaging frameworks. Other document types require different rubrics:

- **POV Narrative rubric** evaluates: opening strategy strength, narrative arc, hero problem introduction timing, inevitable future framing, emotional momentum. See [[concepts/point-of-view]] and [[concepts/pov-opening-strategies]].
- **Homepage rubric** evaluates: hero section clarity, above-the-fold hero problem, social proof placement, CTA clarity, page architecture. See [[concepts/homepage-positioning]] and [[concepts/homepage-structure]].
- **Pitch Deck rubric** evaluates: problem slide clarity, narrative flow across slides, proof slide structure, ask clarity. See [[concepts/pitch-deck-structure]].

These rubrics will be documented in separate concept articles as the wiki expands.
